## SmsAlert

This is a small app I use for monitoring info.kolejeslaskie.com webpage. Delays and train/infrastructure problems in Silesian Railways happen pretty often, and since I travel by these trains a lot, I made an app that monitors and scrapes this informational webpage. If it finds an occurence of any given preset keywords (which are basically my destination station names) it sends SMS to given phone number with alert's title.

In fact KS have this type of service available, at least they advertised it like a year ago, but why not reinvent something if you can? :D
